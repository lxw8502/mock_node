You can set up collections of docsets and easily switch between them using search profiles. For example, let's say you do both macOS and Web development, you could set up a "macOS" search profile which automatically gets activated when Xcode launches and a "Web" search profile which automatically gets activated when Sublime Text launches.

Search profiles persist between Dash launches and searches. If you explicitly do not need persistence, use Docset Keywords.

You can find the search profile settings by clicking on the icon of the main search field
